 MERGE: Merge data for equivalent reflns.
 This routine reads in hkl and F and sigma from any number
 of files, merges equivalent reflections and writes out an
 asymmetric unit of data.

 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000    
 
  This program keeps track of the ratio of rms  differences
  among equivalent reflections to the sigmas.
  Do you want to keep reflections even if chisqr>20?
  1=keep anyways, 0 = toss them. (Usually keep them)>

   LOCALSCALE:  Space-group general scaling.
   In this program the Native data is mapped to the
   asymmetric unit, then expanded to the entire sphere.
   The Derivative data is scaled without mapping to
   the asymmetric unit.
 
   Both native and derivative must be in dorgbn-style
   files.  If anomalous differences are present in the 
   derivative file, they will be scaled and written out.
 
 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000

   LOCALSCALE:  Space-group general scaling.
   In this program the Native data is mapped to the
   asymmetric unit, then expanded to the entire sphere.
   The Derivative data is scaled without mapping to
   the asymmetric unit.
 
   Both native and derivative must be in dorgbn-style
   files.  If anomalous differences are present in the 
   derivative file, they will be scaled and written out.
 
 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000

 MERGE: Merge data for equivalent reflns.
 This routine reads in hkl and F and sigma from any number
 of files, merges equivalent reflections and writes out an
 asymmetric unit of data.

 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000    
 
  This program keeps track of the ratio of rms  differences
  among equivalent reflections to the sigmas.
  Do you want to keep reflections even if chisqr>20?
  1=keep anyways, 0 = toss them. (Usually keep them)>

   LOCALSCALE:  Space-group general scaling.
   In this program the Native data is mapped to the
   asymmetric unit, then expanded to the entire sphere.
   The Derivative data is scaled without mapping to
   the asymmetric unit.
 
   Both native and derivative must be in dorgbn-style
   files.  If anomalous differences are present in the 
   derivative file, they will be scaled and written out.
 
 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000

 MERGE: Merge data for equivalent reflns.
 This routine reads in hkl and F and sigma from any number
 of files, merges equivalent reflections and writes out an
 asymmetric unit of data.

 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000    
 
  This program keeps track of the ratio of rms  differences
  among equivalent reflections to the sigmas.

 MERGE: Merge data for equivalent reflns.
 This routine reads in hkl and F and sigma from any number
 of files, merges equivalent reflections and writes out an
 asymmetric unit of data.

 Resolution range will be from   1.850000      to    1000.000    
 
  This program keeps track of the ratio of rms  differences
  among equivalent reflections to the sigmas.
  Do you want to keep reflections even if chisqr>20?
  1=keep anyways, 0 = toss them. (Usually keep them)>

 This program copies columns of data from the input files
 to the output file.  The columns to copy (and their order)
 are specified by a series of commands of the form:
 File #, then on the next line: ColA,ColB,  
 This command causes columns ColA through ColB from 
 this file to be copied to the output file. 
 
 Note: The tiles of columns usually are just copied to the
 output file.  To change the titles, type the new title
 for ColA at the end of the command line.  The program
 will prompt for titles for the other columns.
