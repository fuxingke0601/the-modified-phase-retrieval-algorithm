 All points to the left of the + signs are in solvent masked region
 those to right are in protein masked region.

 The values of p(protein) should change from low to high approximately at the 
 value of the fraction of solvent indicated by the + signs.
 The sharper the transition the better.

 Note: the mask is only used to make an estimate of the p(protein)

 The values of p(protein) are used to weight the contribution of each grid
  point to the probability of the map:

  p(rho) = p(rho|protein) p(protein) +  p(rho|solvent) (1-p(protein))

 This says that the probability that we would observe  the value rho  of 
 electron density at this point is the probability that we 
 would observe rho if this were really protein times the probability 
 that this is  protein, plus the probability that we would observe
 rho if it were really solvent, times the probability that
 it is solvent.

 Plot of probability that a grid point is part of protein region
 vs percentiles of grid points

 All points to the left of the "+" signs are in solvent masked region
 those to right are in protein masked region.

 The values of p(protein) should change from low to high approximately at the
 value of the fraction of solvent indicated by the "+" signs.
 The sharper the transition the better.

 Note: the mask is only used to make an estimate of the p(protein)

 The values of p(protein) are used to weight the contribution of each grid
 point to the probability of the map:

  p(rho) = p(rho|protein) p(protein) + p(rho|solvent) (1-p(protein))

 This says that the probability that we would observe the value "rho" of
 electron density at this point is the probability that we
 would observe "rho" if this were really protein times the probability
 that this is protein, plus the probability that we would observe
 "rho" if it were really solvent, times the probability that
 it is solvent.
