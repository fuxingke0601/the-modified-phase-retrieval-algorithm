# A Modified Phase-retrieval Algorithm
    A modified phase-retrieval algorithm, incorporating the Ï€-half variant of charge flipping algorithm and direct-methods tangent formula into the relaxed alternating averaged reflection phase-retrieval (RAAR) algorithm, has been developed for the determination of anomalously scattering substructures from single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data of macromolecules. The algorithm is implemented on the 100 different SAD data sets, composed of protein and nucleic acid, and demonstrated superior efficiency and accuracy compared to standard RAAR algorithm in terms of substructure determination. With the automated parameters settings, the algorithm is capable of resolving various SAD experimental data with high coordinate precision, even potentially extending the applicability to challenging cases.
